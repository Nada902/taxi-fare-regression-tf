# 🚖 Chicago Taxi Fare Prediction - Linear Regression with TensorFlow

This project is a programming exercise from Google's **Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC)**. It implements a **linear regression model** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to predict taxi fares based on trip mileage.  

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Train a linear regression model to predict taxi fares using trip mileage.  
- **Dataset**: [Chicago Taxi Rides](https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/chicago_taxi_train.csv).  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.  
- **Training Details**:  
  - Loss Function: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - Optimizer: **RMSprop**  
  - Metrics: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Installation  

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib 
```

### 2️⃣ Running the Notebook  

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Run all cells sequentially.  
3. The model will train and generate performance plots.  

## 📊 Results  

- The model learns to predict fare prices using a simple linear regression approach.  
- RMSE improves over training epochs, showing better predictions.  
- Visualizations help track performance trends.
